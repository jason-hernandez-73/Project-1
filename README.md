# Project-1

### This project is to investigate climate change

### The participants are: Jason Hernandez, Jason Fung, Kevin Lee

We investigated the connection between CO2 emissions, population, and GDP. How are per capita CO2 emissions influenced by per capita GDP? We hypothesize that countries with a higher per capita GDP will have higher per capita CO2 emissions, but is the relationship linear, or another shape?

We used csv files from the World Bank for 1995-2019 data on GDP, per capita CO2 emissions, and population, by country. Per capita GDP is found by dividing GDP by population. We plotted CO2 vs. GDP for five country income categories.

Population, in itself, was not a useful metric. Every country had a steadily rising population. However, population was needed to calculate per capita GDP, since the data available was only for total GDP.

As expected, we found that countries with the highest per capita GDP also had the highest per capita CO2 emissions. However, when countries were categorized by income (Gross National Income, or GNI), we found countries in all income categories had declining per-capita CO2 emissions, even though their total CO2 emissions were rising. We attribute this to improvements in efficient technology.
